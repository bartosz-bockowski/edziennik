To use any function of the project, you first need to access /user/createAdmin link which
creates user of username 'admin' and password '123' and gives this user a role of name 'admin'
which has absolute access to everything in the project.
Then, for security reasons, you should change the password of the admin account.

Adding it to other parts of the application is an idea for the future.
